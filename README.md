Just a simple streamlit app to crawl reddit, twitter(X), google trends and newspapers based on some keywords, timeframe, region and language.
You can get a basic sentiment analysis. Could be extended with AI, reddit subreddits, more newspapers, history, database and more visualizations :D

Feel free to play around and extend :D 

You can visit the page here: https://tr3ndpulse.streamlit.app

You need to have a rapidapi API-Key and you need to add a few apis. For the current ones, please see the about region in the streamlit app.

Thanks and have fun!
